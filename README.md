## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a collection of Java code examples that demonstrate the use of various core Java features. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an intermediate developer wanting to refine your skills, this repository has something for you.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


## Core Concepts

### Streams

Java Streams provide a powerful mechanism to process sequences of data in a functional programming style. Some of the concepts demonstrated in the **streams/** directory include:

- Basic Stream operations (filter, map, reduce)
- Custom Collectors and grouping
- Parallel streams for performance optimization

### I/O Operations

Java I/O (Input/Output) covers reading from and writing to files, handling streams, and serialization. The **io/** directory includes:

- File reading and writing
- BufferedReader for efficient I/O
- Object serialization and deserialization

### Multithreading

Java provides built-in support for multithreading, which allows for concurrent execution of tasks. The **multithreading/** directory demonstrates:

- Thread creation and execution
- Synchronization techniques to avoid race conditions
- Using ExecutorService for managing thread pools
- Handling deadlocks

### Collections

The **collections/** directory demonstrates the use of various data structures in Java such as Lists, Sets, and Maps. Topics include:

- Working with `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`
- Iterating over collections
- Advanced collection operations

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is a critical part of any robust Java application. In the **exceptions/** directory, you'll find:

- Try-catch-finally block usage
- Custom exceptions and handling logic
- Best practices for error handling

### Basic Java Syntax

This section focuses on the foundational elements of Java. You'll find examples on:

- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions and methods
